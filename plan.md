Of course. This is an excellent strategy for building a professional and scalable frontend. By creating the full UI skeleton from the start, you ensure a consistent user experience and make it much easier to progressively enable features as the backend evolves.

Here is a detailed, standalone plan for implementing a Perplexity-style UI, focusing on production-quality styling and future-proofing the interface.

***

### **Frontend Implementation Plan: Perplexity-Style UI**

**Objective:** To create a polished, production-ready frontend application with a user interface inspired by Perplexity. The plan involves building the complete UI skeleton, including all visual components for future features, while only enabling the core search functionality. All non-active UI elements will provide a "Coming Soon" notification to the user.

### **Phase 0: Setup, Styling, and Design System**

**Goal:** To establish the project's foundation by integrating a modern styling framework and defining a consistent design system before a single component is built.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Initialize Next.js Project:** Create a new Next.js application with TypeScript.
2.  **Integrate Tailwind CSS:** Install and configure Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling. This choice allows for rapid development of a custom, production-grade design without being locked into a pre-made component library.
3.  **Define a Basic Design System:** In the `tailwind.config.js` file and global CSS, define the core visual identity of the application:
    *   **Colors:** Define a color palette (e.g., `primary`, `secondary`, `background`, `foreground`, `accent`) for both light and dark modes.
    *   **Typography:** Configure the default fonts, sizes, and weights for headings, paragraphs, and UI text.
    *   **Spacing & Sizing:** Establish a consistent spacing scale for margins, padding, and layout to ensure visual harmony.
4.  **Create Component Directory Structure:** Organize the `components` directory to scale, for example:
    *   `components/layout/`: For major structural components like the Sidebar and Main Content area.
    *   `components/ui/`: For generic, reusable elements like `Button`, `Input`, `Card`, `Spinner`.
    *   `components/features/`: For complex components tied to specific features like `SearchHistoryList` or `UserProfile`.

**Desired Result:** A project that is fully configured for professional styling. A clear, documented design system exists in the codebase, ensuring every subsequent component built will be visually consistent.

### **Phase 1: Building the Static UI Skeleton**

**Goal:** To construct the entire visual layout of the application, including all future UI elements in a static, non-interactive state. This creates the full look and feel of the final product.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Build the Main App Layout:** Create a root layout component that uses CSS Grid or Flexbox to establish the primary two-panel structure: a fixed left sidebar and a main content area that takes the remaining space.
2.  **Create the Static Sidebar Component:** Build the left sidebar with all its intended UI elements:
    *   **Header:** A logo and/or application name.
    *   **New Search Button:** A prominent, primary action button at the top.
    *   **Search History Section:** A list of placeholder search history items (e.g., "History Item 1," "History Item 2"). These will be static links or buttons.
    *   **User Profile Section:** A section at the bottom of the sidebar containing a placeholder avatar, a "Guest" username, and a "Log In" button.
3.  **Create the Static Main Content Area:** Build the right panel, which will house the core interaction:
    *   **Search Bar:** A large, prominent text input field, visually centered as the main point of focus on the initial screen.
    *   **Result Display Area:** A designated, empty container below the search bar where results will eventually be displayed.
4.  **Implement "Coming Soon" Functionality:** Integrate a non-intrusive notification system (e.g., a "toast" library like `react-hot-toast`). Attach a handler to all interactive elements *except* the search bar and its submit button. When clicked, these elements (Log In, Search History items, etc.) will trigger a toast notification that says "Feature Coming Soon!".

**Desired Result:** The application's complete UI is visually rendered with static data. A user can see the entire layout, including the sidebar with history, the user profile area, and the main search interface. Clicking on any future feature provides a polite "Coming Soon" message.

### **Phase 2: Implementing the Core Search Interaction**

**Goal:** To bring the application to life by wiring up the *only* active feature: the search bar and result display. This phase connects the static UI to the backend API.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Develop the Interactive SearchBar Component:** Convert the static search input into a controlled component using React's `useState` hook to manage its value.
2.  **Implement API Communication & State Management:** Create the logic (e.g., in a custom hook or the page component) that handles the form submission. This logic must manage the complete request lifecycle:
    *   **Loading State:** A state variable (e.g., `isLoading`) will be set to `true` when the request starts.
    *   **Error State:** A state variable will capture any potential errors from the API call.
    *   **Result State:** A state variable will store the successful response from the backend.
3.  **Develop the Dynamic ResultDisplay Component:** Make the result area dynamic and responsive to the API state:
    *   **Initial State:** It displays nothing.
    *   **Loading State:** When `isLoading` is `true`, it must display a loading indicator (e.g., a `Spinner` component). This provides crucial user feedback.
    *   **Success State:** When a result is successfully received, it will render the formatted text from the API.
    *   **Error State:** If an error occurs, it will display a user-friendly error message.
4.  **Refine UI States:** Ensure the UI elements visually reflect the current state. For example, the "Submit" button should be disabled and show a spinner while `isLoading` is `true`.

**Desired Result:** The core functionality of the application is now fully interactive. The user can type in the search bar, submit a query, see a loading state, and view the result returned from the backend, all within the context of the complete, professional UI.

### **Phase 3: Responsiveness and Final Polish**

**Goal:** To ensure the application provides a seamless and polished experience across all common device sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Implement Responsive Design:** Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`) to adapt the layout to different screen sizes.
    *   **Mobile View:** The two-panel layout will collapse. The sidebar will be hidden by default and accessible via a "hamburger" menu icon in the header.
    *   **Tablet View:** The layout may show the sidebar collapsed by default or fully visible, depending on the screen width.
    *   **Desktop View:** The full two-panel layout will be displayed.
2.  **Add UI Polish & Micro-interactions:** Enhance the user experience with subtle details:
    *   **Transitions:** Add smooth transitions for hover and focus states on buttons and inputs.
    *   **Animations:** Use subtle animations for the appearance of elements, like the result display area.
3.  **Ensure Accessibility (A11y):** Perform a review to ensure the application is usable by everyone. This includes adding ARIA attributes, ensuring keyboard navigability, and checking for sufficient color contrast.

**Desired Result:** A pixel-perfect, fully responsive application that looks and feels professional on any device. The user experience is smooth, intuitive, and polished, providing a solid foundation for all future feature development.
