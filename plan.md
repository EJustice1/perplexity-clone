### **Implementation Plan: Cost-Minimal, Simple Weekly Subscription Service**

**Objective:**  
Provide a no-frills, low-cost weekly update system using Firestore for subscriptions, Memorystore Redis, Cloud Scheduler, Cloud Run, Celery, and basic SMTP email. Security and IAM roles can be added later.

***

### **Stage 1: Subscription Capture & Storage**

**Goal:**  
Collect and persist user `email`+`topic` subscriptions in Cloud Firestore.

**Steps:**  
1. Expose a web form endpoint that accepts `email` and `topic`.  
2. Validate: non-empty topic, well-formed email.  
3. Insert a Firestore document per subscription with fields:
   - `subscription_id` (UUID)  
   - `email`  
   - `topic`  
   - `created_at` (timestamp)  
   - `is_active` (true)  
   - `last_sent` (null)  

**Outcome:**  
All subscriptions are stored as individual, queryable documents with minimal overhead.

***

### **Stage 2: Single Fixed-Time Trigger**

**Goal:**  
Schedule one weekly job to start batch processing, avoiding always-on servers.

**Steps:**  
1. Configure **Cloud Scheduler** to POST to your Cloud Run dispatcher every Monday at 9 AM.  
2. Use a single cron expression—no per-user jobs.  

**Outcome:**  
A single managed schedule ensures predictable, low-cost invocation.

***

### **Stage 3: Batch Dispatcher on Cloud Run**

**Goal:**  
Retrieve all active subscriptions, group by topic, and enqueue processing tasks.

**Steps:**  
1. Cloud Run handler reads all Firestore subscriptions with `is_active = true`.  
2. Group subscriptions by identical `topic`.  
3. For each topic group, enqueue a Celery task (`process-topic`) with the topic and subscriber emails.  

**Outcome:**  
One Celery task per unique topic, minimizing redundant work and queue messages.

***

### **Stage 4: Topic Processing & Change Detection**

**Goal:**  
Run the LangChain pipeline to detect new information and prepare updates.

**Steps:**  
1. Use Memorystore Redis (single-node instance) to store last week’s baseline per topic.  
2. For each topic task:
   - Run LangChain “recent developments” search.  
   - Compare URLs against Redis baseline to identify new sources.  
   - Compare synthesized answer hashes for content changes.  
3. Update Redis baseline with this week’s sources, answer hash, and timestamp.  

**Outcome:**  
Efficient change detection that only flags topics with fresh content, using minimal Redis resources.

***

### **Stage 5: Individual Email Dispatch**

**Goal:**  
Send one email per subscription for topics with new content.

**Steps:**  
1. Celery worker enqueues a `send-email` task for each subscriber of a topic with updates.  
2. Use a simple SMTP server (or free-tier transactional email) to send plain-text emails.  
3. Include only this week’s new developments and source URLs.  
4. Update each Firestore document’s `last_sent` timestamp.  

**Outcome:**  
Subscribers receive targeted weekly updates; email costs are limited by subscriber count.

***

### **Stage 6: Minimal Configuration & Cost Control**

**Goal:**  
Keep infrastructure simple, serverless, and cost-minimal.

**Steps:**  
1. **Cloud Run Services:**  
   - Set **min instances = 0** for both dispatcher and worker services.  
   - Configure **max instances** modestly (e.g., 5) to bound costs.  
2. **Redis Instance:**  
   - Use the smallest Memorystore tier (single-node).  
   - No high availability until needed.  
3. **Celery Worker Settings:**  
   - Low concurrency (e.g., 2 workers per instance).  
   - `worker_max_tasks_per_child` to avoid memory leaks.  
4. **Email Provider:**  
   - Choose a free-tier SMTP (e.g., Gmail SMTP) or low-cost transactional service.  
5. **Monitoring & Logging:**  
   - Rely on default Cloud Run logs.  
   - No paid monitoring until scale demands.  

**Outcome:**  
An entirely serverless stack that scales to zero between weekly runs, with predictable, minimal costs.

***

### **Extension for Security (Future)**

- **Firestore IAM Roles:** Later assign a service account with Firestore read/write permissions.  
- **Redis ACLs & VPC:** Optionally place Memorystore in a private VPC and restrict access.  
- **Cloud Run IAM:** Later enforce invocation permissions on Cloud Run endpoints.

**Desired Result:**  
A lean, serverless weekly subscription system that runs only once a week, minimizes operational complexity and cost, and remains extensible for future security enhancements.
