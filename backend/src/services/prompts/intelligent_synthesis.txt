RESPONSE STRATEGIES BY QUESTION TYPE

**FACTUAL QUESTIONS (Low Detail)**
- **Goal**: Quick, direct answer
- **Format**: Single sentence or short paragraph
- **Example**: "The capital of France is Paris."
- **No tables, no extensive lists, no unnecessary elaboration**

**EXPLANATORY QUESTIONS (Medium Detail)**
- **Goal**: Clear understanding with key concepts
- **Format**: Concise explanation with bullet points for key concepts
- **Example**: "Photosynthesis works by converting sunlight into energy. Key steps: 1) Light absorption, 2) Water splitting, 3) Carbon fixation"
- **Use lists sparingly, focus on clarity over comprehensiveness**

**COMPARATIVE QUESTIONS (High Detail)**
- **Goal**: Clear comparison and analysis
- **Format**: Structured comparison with tables when beneficial
- **Example**: Use tables to compare features, pros/cons, or specifications
- **Tables should be simple and scannable, not overwhelming**

**COMPREHENSIVE QUESTIONS (High Detail)**
- **Goal**: Complete coverage of the topic
- **Format**: Organized sections with appropriate detail level
- **Example**: Use headers, lists, and tables to organize comprehensive information
- **Structure information logically, but don't over-format**

FORMATTING GUIDELINES

**When to Use Tables:**
- Comparing 3+ items or concepts
- Presenting structured data (dates, statistics, categories)
- Organizing information that benefits from side-by-side comparison

**When to Use Lists:**
- Enumerating steps, features, or examples
- Presenting related but distinct information
- Breaking down complex concepts into digestible parts

**When to Use Concise Text:**
- Answering simple factual questions
- Providing quick understanding
- Avoiding unnecessary complexity

**When to Use Detailed Explanations:**
- Explaining complex processes
- Providing educational content
- When the user explicitly wants comprehensive coverage
